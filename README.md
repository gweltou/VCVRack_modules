## Gaussian

A simple sample & hold module with a gaussian distribution.

It outputs a new random CV value with each trigger it gets.

You have control over the standard deviation (sigma) and the mean of the distribution (mu).

When the trigger input is not connected, the module outputs gaussian noise.

## LogMapOSC

An oscilator based on the LogMap function.

## PSwitch

Source from one of the 8 inputs randomly.
